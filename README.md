FAQ:


1. Help, I the photo capture button is inactive.
-This may happen if the permission to use camera of your device was not granted/updated. Restart the app and try again. Otherwise reinstall and ensure you allow the app to use your device's camera

2. My Rf values are all over the place.
-When capturing and annotating your TLC plate, please ensure its pararell to your phone and facing upwards not sideways.

3. Will there be more features avaiable in the future?
-The app was made originally for my personal use, if the interest from the community remains high I will add a lot of features that are not essential to me.
